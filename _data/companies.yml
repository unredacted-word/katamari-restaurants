    <q>City Girl Café started in 1997 with these two lovely people. We had never
    worked for better bosses and they taught us to be the bosses that we are. As
    we end our mutual 23 year stretch we want to give all the love to our
    mentors Merry and Cheryl.</q>

  notes: >
    <q>Watching a horror movie is more soothing than having to announce that
    Cuchi Cuchi will no longer exist... the fundamental purpose of socializing
    [with] food/wine/good company has been obliterated overnight by an unlucky
    fluke of nature which gives new meaning to ‘survival of the fittest.’ On the
    bright side, perhaps humans will now be more nurturing towards each other
    and the planet and less prone to feeling unabashedly special/invincible</q>
