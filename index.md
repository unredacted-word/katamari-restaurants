# Lost Restaurants of Cambridge and Somerville

_A summary of the running loss of local restaurants due to COVID-19._

With the COVID-19 pandemic creating hazardous working conditions, inflation destroying
real wages, and when $2T-$6T of freshly-printed low-cost credit goes to
deep-pocketed private investment firms, transnational corporations, big banks,
investors and monopolists, and too-little-too-late to localâ€”independent establishments,
we'll quickly see the biggest loss of local restaurants and a corresponding
rise of national chains filling those spaces.

This will fundamentally reshape the terrain of independently run restaurants in
the US and around the globe. The Urban America we know, of heterogeneous small
restaurants would look very different after this pandemic is over&mdash;a
homogeneous space optimized for massive corporations, and reducing local
autonomy and diversity in the process.
